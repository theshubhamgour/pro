<p class="skill-description">Long before I graduated from university with a bachelor's degree, design has always been my passion. Seeing the works from the great designers from the books, really makes me excited and inspired. Not just limited to website designs, but also graphic, product. Even now, I can spend hours just browsing through the pages on the internet, looking for inspiration and ideas from other designers. But inspiration can come not just from previous designs, but sometimes I look for ideas from my everyday life. Well probably it’s because design has become a major part of my life.</p>
